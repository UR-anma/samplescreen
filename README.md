# Academy sample operator screen

Demo operator screen, just an example to showcase capabilities and interact with the UR Academy setup using operator screen

Currently supported features:

- Configuring an operator screen from installation page
- Teaching waypoints and inputting data
- Changing/reading robot IO state from operator screen

At present, urScript generation is not working due to the method not being called at the right moment - in case have a look at AlumotionScreen for another example on that.
